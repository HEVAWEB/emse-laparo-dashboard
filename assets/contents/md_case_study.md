### The laparotomy case study

The data were extracted from the SNIIRAM database. All anonimized patients with a *first laparotomy operation in 2010*, followed by an *incisional hernia (IH) within 5 years* after the operation were selected. This resulted in a total number of *7,906 patients* included in the study, for which all hospitalization information was extracted. From these data, an automated procedure to create relevant medical labels was applied.

Depending on the number of *clusters* (labels), the corresponding results are detailed bellow.
