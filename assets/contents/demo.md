Markdown is quite handy when it comes to:
- write middle lengthed documents
- structure content with headings, list, etc.
- include other assets such as:
    - links
    - images

# Title h1 - reserved for study
## Title h2 - reserved for client
### Title h3 - section title
#### Title h4
##### Title h5
###### Title h6 - Do you really need this?


This is *small emphasis* `*small emphasis*` and **strong emphasis** `**strong emphasis**`.

This is a table:

| Tables |  Are | Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is | left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| col 3 is | *right-aligned* |**$1** |

You can even add emphasis in tables!
