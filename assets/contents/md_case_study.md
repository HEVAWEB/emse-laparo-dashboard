### The laparotomy case study

The data were extracted from the SNIIRAM database. All anonimized patients with a *first laparotomy operation in 2010*, followed by an *incisional hernia (IH) within 5 years* after the operation were selected. This resulted in a total of *7,906 patients* included in the study, for which all hospitalizations information was extracted. From these data, an automated procedure to create relevant medical labels was applied.

Depending on the number of *clusters* (number of different labels in the process model), the corresponding results are detailed bellow.

#### Process model

The process models read from left to right, the size of nodes and edges being, for each process model, proportional to the number of patients represented.

#### Details for each cluster

For each cluster, explaination results are displayed bellow. A visualization of some decoded stays, as well as activation mean and related medical codes are presented. Details on codes (label, level in the corresponding hierarchy and type) are also listed.
