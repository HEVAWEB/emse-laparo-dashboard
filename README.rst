Instructions

How to create a dashboard ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, you need to create a copy of this repository in your own organisation (unfortunately forking is not an option because of GitLab's limitations).
To do so:

1. Create a new **empty** GitLab repository in the correct group/subgroup.
You should choose a friendly name. How about **client-study-dashboard**?

2. Create a local copy of the template repository with
    1. ``git clone -o upstream https://gitlab.hevaweb.com/web/dashboard-template <your friendly name>`` with ``<your friendly name>`` being **client-study-dashboard** for example.

    2. ``cd <your friendly name>``

    3. ``git remote add origin <your new gitlab repo url>`` with the URL we got from step **1.**

    4. ``git push -u origin master``

üéâ Tada! You are good to go.
We needed those tedious steps to be able to update your dashboard and the template from one to another.

**Please note that the steps above are for creating a dashboard.**

If you want to clone an existing dashboard (already on GitLab), you should do these steps instead:

1. ``git clone <your url>``

2. ``cd <your dashboard>``

3. ``git remote add upstream https://gitlab.hevaweb.com/web/dashboard-template``

How to include text documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You could write all the text you need in Python using Dash's HTML components for structure, but an easier way is to include a **Markdown** file stored in ``assets/`` (or ``assets/contents/``.
An example is given in ``apps/context.py`` using ``assets/contents/demo.md``.

How to create interactives graphs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a two-steps answer: use Plotly graphing library and add some Dash callbacks.

1. Plotly Graphing Libraries
............................

Two libraries are listed in the references: Plotly for Python & R.
A graph created with thoses libraries can be used in a Dash dashboard.
The tricky part is that we need to export such a graph from our secure environment to the web server where the Dash backend is running.
The consequence of this statement is that we need to precompute all graphs beforehand.

As for the export format, Plotly graphs can be safely serialised to **Json**, though it may be quite handy to use the **pickle** protocol for Python users to bundle several graphs together.
We will maybe feel the need to develop a script to ease the packaging of R-created graphs.

2. Dash Callbacks
.................

Plotly graphs already have some builtin interactivity like zooming or panning but we are looking for something a bit more ambitious such as updating a graph with menus, sliders, etc.
This is exactly what Dash was designed for.

Each interaction must be implemented as a Python function in its dedicated app (folder ``apps/``).
The idea is quite simple: each specific component has an unique *id* and some internal properties.
A Dash callback is simply a function defined around **inputs** and an **output** that will update the **output** component designated property.
This property can be:

- the entire graph
- the layout
- a stylistic element

An exemple is in ``index.py``.
A global layout is defined with a lateral menu and a content placeholder with:

.. code-block:: python

    app.layout = html.Div(
        [
            dcc.Location(id="url", refresh=False),
            html.Div(
                children=[
                    html.H1("Dashboard"),
                    html.Ul(
                        children=[
                            html.Li(dcc.Link("Context", href="/context")),
                            html.Li(dcc.Link("Outcome", href="/outcome")),
                            ...
                        ]
                    ),
                ],
                className="two columns",
            ),
            html.Div(id="page-content", className="ten columns"),
        ]
    )

Do you see how the layout is composed of a very basic HTML structure with div blocks, title and links?
An important element to notice is the `dcc.Location`, a particular Dash component which keeps track of the webpage URL with an unique id.

Next we have these lines:

.. code-block:: python

    @app.callback(Output("page-content", "children"), [Input("url", "pathname")])
    def display_page(pathname):
        if pathname == "/context" or pathname == "/":
            return context.layout
        elif pathname == "/outcome":
            return outcome.layout
        ...


Here is how a callback is defined. This one will update the ``children`` property of the ``page-content`` element based on the ``pathname`` property state for the ``url`` component which is as seen above the browser URL.
When the user navigate through the link in the menu, this will trigger this callback which will update the content of the website with the content of the corresponding app in ``apps/``.

Using the very same principles, this is how we can allow our user to interact with graphs using buttons, slider, dropdown menus, etc.

See also `<https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started-part-2>`_.

3. Export graphs
................

The prefered export format for graph is **json**, although Python users may use pickled graphs if they want.

1. Python export

At some point, you shoud have a Plotly figure with something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    fig = go.Figure(data, layout)

You may export this figure to a **json** file using the following snippet:

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    from homemade.utils import NumpyEncoder

    with open("<output-path>", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(fig.to_dict(), f, cls=NumpyEncoder)

2. R export

Coming soon.

3. Graph layout

**Please note that your Plotly graphs should have the bare minimum layout!**

The dashboard has a built-in HEVA theme to apply to every graph.
Try to specify only titles and readability elements, not colors & fonts for example.

What file(s) do I need to modify to...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add/Remove a page?
..................

- Add/Remove the corresponding app in ``apps/``
- Add/Remove the assets used (images, ``.md`` files, etc.)
- In ``index.py``

  - Add/Remove the app import
  - Add/Remove the menu link
  - Add/Remove the callback condition

Include an asset?
.................

Assets are (but not limited to):

- images
- markdown files
- stylesheets
- javascript files


All assets except for graphs should be stored in the ``assets/`` folder.
You may access an asset in an app with the ``assets/<filename>`` path.
Please note that ``.css``, ``.ico`` & ``.js`` files are automatically served by the Dash server.

Include graphs?
...............

Graphs should be stored in the ``builds/`` folder.
We separate them from standard assets because they can be quite heavy and we are still thinking how we should specifically handle them.
You may access a graph in an app with the ``builds/<filename>`` path.

Graphs are typically stored using **json** or **pickle** formats.

1. Json

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    import plotly.graph_objs as go

    with open("<path to your file>", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        graph = go.Figure(json.load(f))

2. Pickle

.. code-block:: python

    import pickle
    import plotly.graph_objs as go

    with open("<path to your file>", "rb") as f:
        graph = go.Figure(pickle.load(f))

A few words on the codes above, we build a new Plotly figure with ``go.Figure()`` on the loaded figure for a good reason: it allows us to override the layout with the HEVA theme.
This is why graphs in the dashboard look different from the ones you exported earlier.


Define a callback in an app?
............................

You may do exactly as in the **Dash Callbacks** section.
Just remember that you need to import the Dash global application with ``from app import app`` to access the callback decorator ``@app.callback()`` to decorate your function.

Share something across apps?
................................

Since all apps can access the ``app.py`` module namespace, if you need an asset in multiple apps (let us say a logo for instance), you can define it in ``app.py`` and import it in every app where it is needed.

How to deploy a dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask the devs to create the `.hevaweb.com` subdomain (same as the project name on GitLab)
2. Change the default authentication credentials in `identifiants.csv`
3. Push your changes to GitLab
4. In **CI/CD** > **Pipelines**, wait for the job(s) to finish and then use the **Manual job** button on the right to deploy your dashboard.

Please note that you also follow the procedure described `here <https://gitlab.hevaweb.com/heva/docker-images>`_.
Feel free to reach a dev for help.

How to update your dashboard with the template's latest developments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may need to update the template with bug fixes, design improvements or just dependencies upgrades.
In order to benefit on your dashboard from these developments, you need to do the following procedure:

1. If not done already, add upstream remote to your git repository ``git remote add upstream https://gitlab.hevaweb.com/web/dashboard-template``.
You can check that the upstream was properly added with ``git remote -v``

2. Fetch upstream latest developments ``git fetch upstream``

3. Merge upstream master on top of your current branch ``git merge upstream/master``

4. Resolve potential git conflicts

You could do step **3.** on an isolated branch in order to deal with potentials conflicts without stress.

How to update the template with something from your dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When working on your own dashboard, you could code something the template may benefit from (such as a bug fix, an ui improvement, etc.).

You can create a Merge Request on GitLab from your dashboard to the template with the following steps:

1. If not done already, add upstream remote to your git repository ``git remote add upstream https://gitlab.hevaweb.com/web/dashboard-template``.
You can check that the upstream was properly added with ``git remote -v``

2. Fetch upstream latest developments ``git fetch upstream``

3. Create a new local branch from upstream with ``git checkout -b <new-branch-name> upstream/master``

4. Squash your modifications on top of your current new branch ``git merge --squash <branch_with_modifications>``

5. Resolve potential git conflicts & **remove all code/graphs/whatever related to your study**. You do not want to merge your graphs into the template!

6. ``git push --set-upstream origin <new-branch-name>``

7. Go to https://gitlab.hevaweb.com/web/dashboard-template and open a Merge Request. Thank you kindly for your contribution!
